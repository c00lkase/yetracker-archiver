Before The College Dropout	???	A verse that Kanye wrote when he was a teenager. This verse is notable because it was publicly identified by Donda West as one of her favorite Kanye verses in a 2003 video that was later used in the jeen-yuhs documentary. He also rapped the verse during an interview with Chris Campion. It's unknown if Kanye ever recorded the verse on an actual track. There are more lyrics to the verse according to Kanye, but he forgot them.  "I walk through the halls of the school and it‚Äôs cool To be known by many for my rapping ability But what about the brothers who ain't got it like me? Making money off the trade, you could say I had it made Drugs are on the rise and it's not a big surprise You see no soul in a young brother's eyes Trying to be hard by the streets but the streets kinda hard But here's another factor we wanna disregard Black-on-black is a stab in my back It really hurts my soul when I hear about that"				Confirmed	Not Available	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwX0-UWsrW8

It features string arrangements, choirs, and his signature soul sampling, frequently branded as "chipmunk soul" for its sped-up and high-pitched nature. Contrary to the popular gangster-persona lyrics at the time, his songs mostly revolved around themes of family, materialism, religion, and racism. The inspiration for finally making his music came when he was in a near-fatal car crash.

This album included a much more electronic sound, featuring layering synthesizers. Lyrically, Kanye analyzes himself and talks about his life after becoming famous and how the media criticize him.

Kanye dealt with his pain by channeling it into a sonically stripped-down album, one dominated by his use of the titular Roland TR-808 drum machine and Auto-Tune. This album significantly influenced future hip-hop music, having influenced Drake, Future, Travis Scott, and more.

The death of his mother derailed this plan, with his fourth album becoming the somber 808s & Heartbreak. People still expected Good Ass Job to release, though, as Kanye's next album as late as early 2010. When the wake of the 2009 VMAs incident happened, it would cause Good Ass Job not to release. The title seems to have changed to MBDTF around May 2010 or atleast not called GAJ anymore. The cover included for this era is the original cover for the single "POWER."

Good Ass Job	‚ú® See Me Again [V1] (See You Again)	Unfinished track, with some mumble lyrics, leaked from just over a month before My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy dropped.

Interpolates "I Never Want To See You Again" by Quasi. This leak gained notable popularity after a widespread theory that it was a "suicide note" of sorts, further influenced by the discovery that the song shared a similar chord progression to "Futari Dake No CEREMONY" by the late J-pop star Yukiko Okada, who comitted suicide in April of 1986 due to alleged relationship issues - which can allude to Kanye's troubles at this time that would result in his breakup with Amber Rose - however this relation has since been debunked and is mostly viewed as a coincidence.	9:10		Oct 22, 2010	Full	High Quality	https://pillows.su/f/73120a5378cbd6feb93befb3f47ea5e1

Good Ass Job	Unknown [Madvillainz Collaborations]	It is heavily implied that Kanye, MF DOOM and Madlib formed a supergroup called Madvillainz in 2009. After MF DOOM's death, rapper J Rocc revealed that Kanye and MF DOOM wanted to form a group called Madvillainz. Kanye's barber Ibn Jasper also said in an Instagram post that he'll always remember the secret studio sessions, implying DOOM and Kanye recorded together. The first Madvillainz remix that released, "Gazillion Ear", featured a Kanye intro. When the Madvillainz remix of "Victory Laps" came out, DOOM's label Lex Records stated that Madvillainz was allegedly made up of Kanye, Madlib, and DOOM. Talib Kweli also tweeted out in 2009 that he was in the studio with Kanye, DOOM and Madlib, although allegedly no music was recorded. It is possible more music came out of the Madvillainz group than just the "Gazillion Ear" and "Victory Lap" remixes and "Disastrous".				Rumored	Not Available

So they merged the titles, "Let's just call it "Murder to Excellence." The transition was so powerful because it flowed so smooth and it sounded, with the samples that Swizz and I chose they were very familiar, but different, so it just blended so well".

Cut during delays and reworks of the album, but eventually ended up on Kid Cudi's Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon album as a solo Kid Cudi song. Confirmed by Travis to be a "Travis Scott Kanye Killhoffer production". Claimed by Pharaohxx to be an early version of "Shit On You", but may also contain elements of "Bad Mood" which heavily features the word "Fuck" and was eventually incorporated into "Shit On You" as a single song on Owl Pharaoh. Travis and Anthony Kilhoffer produced "Shit On You", so it's likely this version uses that instrumental rather than the later version featuring the Daft Punk and Michael Jackson samples.

He swapped lush soul and anthemic hooks for splintering electro, acid house, and industrial force while packaging some of his most lewd and heart-crushing tales. Initially envisioned as Thank God For Drugs, a much larger project, Kanye would play the album for Rick Rubin, he later recalled listening to roughly 3-hours of unfinished material that seemed to need months worth of work - despite the release date being a month away. Kanye enlisted Rubin to refine and complete the project, finishing a majority of the songs just two days before release.

But as I was editing the song and working through it‚Ä¶I just really liked it the way it was‚Ä¶She just sounds so cool. And I started sort of putting it in certain spots and shaping it up so that it was like a reoccurring part, a hook.

Thus, shortly after Yeezus was released, an EP of leftovers titled Lost Yeezus was already being teased. The project then evolved into a full-fledged album of mostly new material, with Yeezus 2 acting as a codename before they could choose the last name.

Mistaken as a Hitler era track, since the producer for "Paradise" revealed Kanye had reached out Christmas 2016 for the stems - later using them to make an altered version of the song to use as background for a sentimental home video posted by Kim Kardashian to twitter. Also thought to be made later because "Paradise" wasn't released until December 2015, but it was found that the song was previewed before, with Jeremih's album having already been delayed multiple times since 2013.

Kanye also continued to work on many So Help Me God and Yeezus 2 tracks, but by the end of 2015 and the start of 2016, Kanye had dropped most of these tracks from the tracklist for SWISH, which began to resemble the final TLOP tracklist strongly.

SWISH	‚≠ê Over [V14] (feat. Bon Iver & The-Dream) (prod. Daft Punk) (Can't Get Over Me, Fall Out Of Heaven)	OG Filename: KW - Over Ref (8.16.15) Filename seen in a folder of August 2015 tracks. Cut-down version of "Can't Get Over Me" with some production elements removed, less Bon Iver vocals, and re-recorded verses from Kanye, with some alternate lyrics. Still contains mumble.   TLDR: There is more evidence that the song is "Over" than there is that the song is "Fall Out Of Heaven." Originally leaked as "Fall Out Of Heaven," but as The Germans also originally said "Pressure" was titled "Can U Be," it makes sense that they would rename this track as well (as both titles "Pressure" and "Over" aren't vocally stated in the respective tracks). This version of the song also contains lyrics shared with "Famous" and "Only" (both recorded in late 2015) as well as a sample later used on "2 Rihannas" and "FML" (added to both in late 2015). The Germans are confirmed to have tracks from the August 2015 folder (in the tracklists tab) such as "Prayer" and "Ultimate Lie," as well as Post Malone references for some of those August 2015 files. Their version of "Pressure" is likely also August 2015 based on the stems we have for the leaked version. Most of the leaked German files for the LP7 era are late 2015 as well.	3:52	Aug 16, 2015	Feb 18, 2016	Full	CD Quality	https://pillows.su/f/3544d591cc76872b7cae1c1a92901bc9

However, work on the album was short-lived, as Kanye began touring in August 2016 and scrapped the concept entirely after being diagnosed as bipolar.

The concept of the album came together in 2018. The album's subject matter varied wildly, with some songs being about introspection and change and others discussing his political views. The public name given for this album is LOVE EVERYONE, but it is known that Kanye likely considered the Hitler title longer.

The project was supposed to be just seven tracks long, similar to all the Wyoming albums. The central theme of this project is a celebration, as many of the tracks we've heard from this project seem to be very joyful and uplifting. Kanye and Chance presumably canceled it sometime in 2019. This project has no covers we know of, so we have used unofficial artwork.			
Good Ass Job (2018)	All We Got Is Love [V1] (We Got, We Love)	Song played during the same Good Ass Job recording session as "In My Eyes".

Said by him to be an "old one", the file played in the session appears to have a finished Chance verse that was recorded prior, with the rest presumably being open. Samples "Supernatural" by We Are King. File linked is from Ant Clemons' mic stem from the later session, this entry is for the open verse he is recording over.

With the album's concept in his mind, Kanye and his producers began frenzied work as they developed multiple new songs throughout September 2018, aiming for a September 29 release date. As they did not meet this deadline, Kanye went to Uganda to conduct further work on the album, but delayed it indefinitely on November 13.

Shortly after the announcement of the delay, Kanye underwent a sudden and dramatic conversion towards born-again evangelical Christianity, debuting the Sunday Service Choir at the start of 2019. The creation of the choir coincided with the songs on Yandhi taking a new Christian lyrical focus. Eventually, the album would morph into the thoroughly Christian JESUS IS KING by mid-2019.

It didn't, and there were no updates for almost a month. On October 20, 2019, Kanye suddenly reappeared on Twitter to announce the final release date.

While the name remained the same, the sound shifted to be more experimental and less soulful. Working with producers such as E.VAX, Dem Jointz, and Digital Nas, Kanye went through hundreds of beats, laying down vocals and trying to come up with ideas for songs. This era would continue until Kanye decided to finalize the album, shifting to the more minimalistic release sound.

Tracker Guidelines		Editor Comments		Misc. Notes				
Remember to use the right formatting. If you feel like something is missing or you did something wrong, copy something a previous submission has already done and use that as the guideline or just ask someone.		Currently, the best sites for uploading files are: Pillowcase, Pixeldrain & ImgBB.		The universal tracker timezone is "EST". If something leaks, make sure to look at the EST timezone to get the date right.				
No fan remakes, no unofficial mixtapes, nothing that's commercially available, always upload to a site that can be streamed off of.		cobalt.tools is really good for downloading any type of video (YouTube, TikTok, Vimeo etc). Make sure to go to the settings and change "audio bitrate" to be 320kbps.		All dates are to be written in "Month Day, Year" format as opposed to the "Month/Day/Year or Day/Month/Year" format.				
Make sure you use alternating colors and check often that they are not broken (Format, Alternating Colors, choose white and the grey that has one grey in between it and white.)		When linking to sources like web interviews, highlight over what is relevant with your mouse and then right click "Copy link to highlight". Doing so jumps straight to the part you highlighted and makes it stand out, which helps a ton.		If you change the color/name of an era even slightly, make sure to apply the changes in every other page of the Tracker (Released, Stems, Album Copies & Misc). Same with adding/removing eras.				
No released remixes, no matter how obscure, should be on this page. Those should be in Misc / Released.		For sources with YouTube videos, go to the timestamp you need and right click "Copy Video URL at current time" instead of just copying the video. Use if it's stuff that needs it (e.g. long interviews).		When adding sample info to an entry, make sure it's the earliest version with the sample that it's mentioned on or for certain entries it should be the Best Of / Special version.				
All music video editions, live freestyles, and released remixes go in Misc / Released.				"Avaliable Length" matters more than "Quality", if there is a LQ partial snippet and a lossless snippet, the LQ partial takes presidence as it's longer.				
				"Rumored | Not Avaliable" always have N/A if they don't have a link, "Conficting Sources | Not Avaliable" and Confirmed | Not Avaliable" do not.				
				Do not write the name of the song in the notes column. Note down sample names and other songs if they need to be crossreferenced, but not the actual song name of the song in notes.				
				Please don't use the restore function if there's new info unless its extremely necessary.

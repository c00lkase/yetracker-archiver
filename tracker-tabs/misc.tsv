	The College Dropout (I'm Good)	(08/18/2002) (Kanye announces he signed to Roc-A-Fella) (02/10/2004) (The College Dropout officially releases)			Following his signing to Roc-A-Fella Records, Kanye released his debut studio album, The College Dropout. It features string arrangements, choirs, and his signature soul sampling, frequently branded as "chipmunk soul" for its sped-up and high-pitched nature. Contrary to the popular gangster-persona lyrics at the time, his songs mostly revolved around themes of family, materialism, religion, and racism. The inspiration for finally making his music came when he was in a near-fatal car crash.

	808s & Heartbreak	(09/11/2007) (Graduation officially releases) (11/24/2008) (808s & Heartbreak officially releases)			Following the death of his mother due to complications after cosmetic surgery, his relationship with fiancé Alexis Phifer finally ending for good, and a struggle to adapt to his celebrity status, Kanye felt emotionally drained and lost. Kanye dealt with his pain by channeling it into a sonically stripped-down album, one dominated by his use of the titular Roland TR-808 drum machine and Auto-Tune. This album significantly influenced future hip-hop music, having influenced Drake, Future, Travis Scott, and more.

	Good Ass Job (Winter Spring Summer Fall)	(11/24/2008) (808s & Heartbreak officially releases) (05/??/2010) (The project shifts into My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)			As far back as 2003, Kanye had planned a four-album series revolving around going to college, with Good Ass Job concluding the series. The death of his mother derailed this plan, with his fourth album becoming the somber 808s & Heartbreak. People still expected Good Ass Job to release, though, as Kanye's next album as late as early 2010. When the wake of the 2009 VMAs incident happened, it would cause Good Ass Job not to release. The title seems to have changed to MBDTF around May 2010 or atleast not called GAJ anymore. The cover included for this era is the original cover for the single "POWER."

With grand production that sounds like the natural evolution of all the albums that came before it, this is seen by many as Kanye's best album, even earning an extremely rare 10/10 rating from Pitchfork.

My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy	Monster [Music Video]	A music video for "Monster" was supposed to be released, but MTV refused to air it. After hearing this, and because the video leaked a few days prior, Kanye took it off of YouTube. The text at the beginning is blurry, but is able to be read as, "The following content is in no way to be interpreted as misogynistic or negative towards any group of people. It is an art piece and shall be taken as such." This version includes an altered outro from the Bon Iver outro that is missing a single line. The music video depicts Nicki as a vampire, Kanye as Dr. Frankenstein, and has many other references to Thriller movies such as American Psycho, Saw, and Michael Jackson's "Thriller". An unfinished version leaked and is included in the link section as well as a behind the scenes video, which depicts Rick Ross eating a fetus (NSFW).

He swapped lush soul and anthemic hooks for splintering electro, acid house, and industrial force while packaging some of his most lewd and heart-crushing tales. Initially envisioned as Thank God For Drugs, a much larger project, Kanye would play the album for Rick Rubin, he later recalled listening to roughly 3-hours of unfinished material that seemed to need months worth of work - despite the release date being a month away. Kanye enlisted Rubin to refine and complete the project, finishing a majority of the songs just two days before release.

The project then evolved into a full-fledged album of mostly new material, with Yeezus 2 acting as a codename before they could choose the last name.

Despite intending to release the album in March 2015, Kanye never finished So Help Me God, and only a few songs from the era ended up on The Life Of Pablo.

	SWISH	(06/28/2015) (Kanye performs at Glastonbury) (12/31/2015) (Kanye drops "Facts," and the rollout begins)			After changing the name of his 7th solo album from So Help Me God to SWISH, Kanye began to develop all new songs throughout mid-late 2015 meant for the album, with most of them eventually making it onto the final release of The Life Of Pablo. Kanye also continued to work on many So Help Me God and Yeezus 2 tracks, but by the end of 2015 and the start of 2016, Kanye had dropped most of these tracks from the tracklist for SWISH, which began to resemble the final TLOP tracklist strongly.

Sporadic and scatter-shot, the album is one of a kind. The title refers to three people: artist Pablo Picasso, drug dealer Pablo Escobar, and Paul the Apostle, whose name is Pablo in Spanish. The album was initially released only on TIDAL, but later made its way to other streaming services with some updates. Kanye finally finished it by adding the track "Saint Pablo."

The concept of the album came together in 2018. The album's subject matter varied wildly, with some songs being about introspection and change and others discussing his political views. The public name given for this album is LOVE EVERYONE, but it is known that Kanye likely considered the Hitler title longer.

The project was supposed to be just seven tracks long, similar to all the Wyoming albums. The central theme of this project is a celebration, as many of the tracks we've heard from this project seem to be very joyful and uplifting. Kanye and Chance presumably canceled it sometime in 2019. This project has no covers we know of, so we have used unofficial artwork.

With the album's concept in his mind, Kanye and his producers began frenzied work as they developed multiple new songs throughout September 2018, aiming for a September 29 release date. As they did not meet this deadline, Kanye went to Uganda to conduct further work on the album, but delayed it indefinitely on November 13.

The creation of the choir coincided with the songs on Yandhi taking a new Christian lyrical focus. Eventually, the album would morph into the thoroughly Christian JESUS IS KING by mid-2019.

	DONDA [V1] (DONDA: WITH CHILD, DND WTH CHLD, DND, God's Country, The First Born Donda)	(07/18/2020) (Kanye announces his new album titled DONDA)  (03/07/2021) (CyHi confirms that Kanye has resumed work on the album)			With new inspiration to work on an album dedicated to his mother, Kanye continued working on previous demos and new ideas. The music of this era reflects Donda's impact on Kanye in a colorful sound while reflecting his mania and the stress he was going through focusing on his businesses while also running for President. With multiple failed release dates for the album, Kanye went into silence in early 2021, finishing up tracks until the album morphed into something very different.

While the name remained the same, the sound shifted to be more experimental and less soulful. Working with producers such as E.VAX, Dem Jointz, and Digital Nas, Kanye went through hundreds of beats, laying down vocals and trying to come up with ideas for songs. This era would continue until Kanye decided to finalize the album, shifting to the more minimalistic release sound.

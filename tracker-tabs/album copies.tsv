	Before The College Dropout	(06/08/1977) (Kanye West is born in Atlanta) (08/18/2002) (Kanye announces he signed to Roc-A-Fella)			Before Kanye released his first album to critical acclaim in 2004, he pursued many other projects, including a rap trio group named the "Go Getters" and production for other rappers, including, but not limited to JAY-Z, Common, Talib Kweli, and Scarface. Two years before the release of The College Dropout, Kanye began releasing a series of mixtapes to generate hype and publicity for the eventual release of his first album. Kanye eventually signed with Roc-A-Fella records in August 2002.

	The College Dropout (I'm Good)	(08/18/2002) (Kanye announces he signed to Roc-A-Fella) (02/10/2004) (The College Dropout officially releases)			Following his signing to Roc-A-Fella Records, Kanye released his debut studio album, The College Dropout. It features string arrangements, choirs, and his signature soul sampling, frequently branded as "chipmunk soul" for its sped-up and high-pitched nature. Contrary to the popular gangster-persona lyrics at the time, his songs mostly revolved around themes of family, materialism, religion, and racism. The inspiration for finally making his music came when he was in a near-fatal car crash.

	808s & Heartbreak	(09/11/2007) (Graduation officially releases) (11/24/2008) (808s & Heartbreak officially releases)			Following the death of his mother due to complications after cosmetic surgery, his relationship with fianc√© Alexis Phifer finally ending for good, and a struggle to adapt to his celebrity status, Kanye felt emotionally drained and lost. Kanye dealt with his pain by channeling it into a sonically stripped-down album, one dominated by his use of the titular Roland TR-808 drum machine and Auto-Tune. This album significantly influenced future hip-hop music, having influenced Drake, Future, Travis Scott, and more.

	Good Ass Job (Winter Spring Summer Fall)	(11/24/2008) (808s & Heartbreak officially releases) (05/??/2010) (The project shifts into My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)			As far back as 2003, Kanye had planned a four-album series revolving around going to college, with Good Ass Job concluding the series. The death of his mother derailed this plan, with his fourth album becoming the somber 808s & Heartbreak. People still expected Good Ass Job to release, though, as Kanye's next album as late as early 2010. When the wake of the 2009 VMAs incident happened, it would cause Good Ass Job not to release. The title seems to have changed to MBDTF around May 2010 or atleast not called GAJ anymore. The cover included for this era is the original cover for the single "POWER."

Around February of 2009 they started working on "Good Ass Job" and brought some work over from 2008, with development really kicking in around April 2009. The title seems to have changed to MBDTF around May 2010 or atleast not called GAJ anymore. "Runaway", "So Appalled", "Hell Of A Life", and some others were made very early on.

With grand production that sounds like the natural evolution of all the albums that came before it, this is seen by many as Kanye's best album, even earning an extremely rare 10/10 rating from Pitchfork.

He swapped lush soul and anthemic hooks for splintering electro, acid house, and industrial force while packaging some of his most lewd and heart-crushing tales. Initially envisioned as Thank God For Drugs, a much larger project, Kanye would play the album for Rick Rubin, he later recalled listening to roughly 3-hours of unfinished material that seemed to need months worth of work - despite the release date being a month away. Kanye enlisted Rubin to refine and complete the project, finishing a majority of the songs just two days before release.

Thus, shortly after Yeezus was released, an EP of leftovers titled Lost Yeezus was already being teased. The project then evolved into a full-fledged album of mostly new material, with Yeezus 2 acting as a codename before they could choose the last name. This project would develop into So Help Me God as the songs evolved.

Sporadic and scatter-shot, the album is one of a kind. The title refers to three people: artist Pablo Picasso, drug dealer Pablo Escobar, and Paul the Apostle, whose name is Pablo in Spanish. The album was initially released only on TIDAL, but later made its way to other streaming services with some updates. Kanye finally finished it by adding the track "Saint Pablo."

With the album's concept in his mind, Kanye and his producers began frenzied work as they developed multiple new songs throughout September 2018, aiming for a September 29 release date.

	WAR (Collaboration with James Blake & No I.D.)	(04/??/2022) (The project is conceived) (??/??/2023) (The project is scrapped)			A collaborative project between Ye, James Blake and No I.D. Sessions for the project began around April/May 2022. On his third Drink Champs interview, Ye referred to these sessions as work for "their album". Three songs from the project were played at a party featured on Naomi Campbell's Instagram, with the song "Always" being previewed in full at YZY Season 9 shortly thereafter. The project was presumably scrapped in the wake of Ye's numerous antisemitic comments. However, insiders have stated the project is still being worked on, and was worked on in 2023.

On September 28th, 2024, on the second Haikou listening event, Ye confirmed that the album name is Bully, which references the movie with the same name that he posted on his Instagram story a few days prior to the event. On January 2nd, 2025, Ye announced the album would have AI on it after months of speculation, and that it could help AI become used more in music. After the release of Bully V1, Ye confirms his intention to re-record the AI on Bully, and stated it was being mixed.

On April 2nd. 2025, DJ Akademiks would post a series of Tweets that eventually led to the announcement of a new album titled WW3, separating this project from BULLY.

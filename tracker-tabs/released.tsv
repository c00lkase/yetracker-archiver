It features string arrangements, choirs, and his signature soul sampling, frequently branded as "chipmunk soul" for its sped-up and high-pitched nature. Contrary to the popular gangster-persona lyrics at the time, his songs mostly revolved around themes of family, materialism, religion, and racism. The inspiration for finally making his music came when he was in a near-fatal car crash.

Inspiration came from stadium tours, indie rock, and house music. It was a considerable departure from the sound Kanye had used on his first two studio albums, which featured samples and inspirations from the soul and orchestral music Kanye grew up alongside. This album included a much more electronic sound, featuring layering synthesizers. Lyrically, Kanye analyzes himself and talks about his life after becoming famous and how the media criticize him.

0 Album Track(s) 2 Single(s) 43 Feature(s) 18 Production 7 Other	Good Ass Job (Winter Spring Summer Fall)	(11/24/2008) (808s & Heartbreak officially releases) (05/??/2010) (The project shifts into My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)			As far back as 2003, Kanye had planned a four-album series revolving around going to college, with Good Ass Job concluding the series. The death of his mother derailed this plan, with his fourth album becoming the somber 808s & Heartbreak. People still expected Good Ass Job to release, though, as Kanye's next album as late as early 2010. When the wake of the 2009 VMAs incident happened, it would cause Good Ass Job not to release. The title seems to have changed to MBDTF around May 2010 or atleast not called GAJ anymore. The cover included for this era is the original cover for the single "POWER."

9 Album Track(s) 4 Single(s) 13 Feature(s) 7 Production 8 Other	Yeezus (Thank God For Drugs, Nigger Cock)	(08/12/2011) (Watch The Throne (Deluxe) officially releases) (06/29/2012) (No I.D. says he's working on Kanye's latest solo album) (06/18/2013) (Yeezus officially releases)			Yeezus marked a complete reverse from the bombastic production that Kanye accomplished on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. He swapped lush soul and anthemic hooks for splintering electro, acid house, and industrial force while packaging some of his most lewd and heart-crushing tales. Initially envisioned as Thank God For Drugs, a much larger project, Kanye would play the album for Rick Rubin, he later recalled listening to roughly 3-hours of unfinished material that seemed to need months worth of work - despite the release date being a month away. Kanye enlisted Rubin to refine and complete the project, finishing a majority of the songs just two days before release.

Thus, shortly after Yeezus was released, an EP of leftovers titled Lost Yeezus was already being teased. The project then evolved into a full-fledged album of mostly new material, with Yeezus 2 acting as a codename before they could choose the last name. This project would develop into So Help Me God as the songs evolved.

Essentially being a more advanced version of the songs developed during the Yeezus 2 era, So Help Me God gained significant hype as the teaser tracks of "Wolves," "All Day," and "Only One" was revealed to the public. Despite intending to release the album in March 2015, Kanye never finished So Help Me God, and only a few songs from the era ended up on The Life Of Pablo.
